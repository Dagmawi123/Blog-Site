The smell of the rotting bodies hangs in the air at the Kfar Aza kibbutz, where Hamas terrorists massacred families including 40 children before apparently beheading some of them in a savage attack on Israeli soil. 

The small kibbutz, popular with young parents, was one of the first Israeli settlements to be targeted on Saturday morning by the rampaging terrorists who unleashed horrors that defy belief.

It was here that the Hamas gunmen, wielding assault rifles and grenades, ruthlessly shot dead screaming families as they begged for their lives before setting fire to their homes.
The terror began just after dawn on Saturday morning when most of the 400 Israeli residents living at the Kfar Aza kibbutz were either sleeping or enjoying their breakfast with coffee.

The first wave of 70 Hamas terrorists had roared towards the quiet kibbutz on motorbikes after they tore through the border wire a mile away, while others paraglided over Israel's unsuspecting defences from Gaza.

As soon as they arrived, the heavily armed fighters attacked the compound from four directions - starting with the 'baby quarter' on the west side where all the young families lived.

The terrorists were met by a frantic kibbutz guard, a small group of residents with military experience who were patrolling the perimeter when they saw the swarm of black figures racing towards them on their motorbikes. 

They - like the Israeli military and government - were not prepared for the wave of terrorists firing streams of bullets at them. The small security squad tried in vain to protect their neighbours, but they couldn't hold the terrorists off and they were killed in the intense fighting.
